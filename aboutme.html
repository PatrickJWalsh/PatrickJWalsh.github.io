									<h3>Hey, I'm Patrick<br />
									</h3>
									<p>I'm a recent graduate of Binghamton University (Go Bearcats).  Sports enthusiast, management consultant (<a href="https://www.kearney.com/" target="_blank" style="color:blue">Kearney</a>), and avid gamer are just a few ways to describe me.  Self-improvement is a top priority of mine, and I'm always looking for my next pursuit.   </p,

								<h3><a href="#">Athletics<br /> </a></h3>
								<p>As a lifelong athlete, sports have always been a huge part of my life.  Growing up, basketball and football were my biggest passions (shoutout Syosset LI Championship Team).  After high school, I still wanted athletics to remain an outlet for my competitiveness, so I took up running.  Since then, I've completed a spartan race (Greek Peak) and a half marathon.  Currently, I'm working towards a marathon, and I'd be ecstatic to shoot under 100 on the golf course.    </p>

								<h3><a href="#">Gaming<br /> </a></h3>
								<p>Growing up, when I wasn't on a court or field, I usually had a controller (or mouse and keyboard) in hand.  Sony's PlayStation 2 was the first console I played extensively, but after seeing my brothers play on the PC, I took up Blizzard's World of Warcraft for a few years.  I'd say you can learn as much about teamwork, optimizing resources, and other useful skills in some video games as you can in many in-person settings.  To be honest, I think it takes more coordination and understanding of one's role to complete one of WoW's 10/25 main raids, and as much trust/communication to play at a high rank in most games as it does to do fairly well on a group project/presentation.  Otherwise, like many other things in my life, games provide another opportunity for me to compete, and the positive feedback loop from improving is always encouraging.  Like many other kids, I dreamed of playing professionally, so I dumped a disgusting amount of hours into Riot's League of Legends, ultimately stopping after realizing the opportunity cost of spending all day in my room (and that I wasn't quite that good), but not before hitting a peak rank of top 400 on the North American ranked ladder.  Nowadays, I'm a casual who enjoys playing Among Us and other games with friends.</p>

								<h3><a href="#">Solving Problems<br /> </a></h3>
								<p>Whether in a game, academic setting, or professional realm, I've always found satisfaction in finding solutions to challenging problems.  An investment in a skill or knowledge to enhance my problem solving ability is one I'm always willing to take, so recently, I've been studying data science principles and techniques to expand my tool kit.  I have experience as an intern with a NYC startup (<a href="https://routinely.co/" target="_blank" style="color:blue">Routinely</a>), and will be starting my career in the consulting industry, but I am always open to the next opportunity.    </p>
